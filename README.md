To ensure that the banks are lending money only
to those who can absolutely pay back their loan on time, banks
should have as much information as possible on the borrower,
including his credit history, income, and net worth distributed
throughout various asset classes. Our work is to analyze the
data and come up with a means of quantifying the credit
worthiness of a customer. This quantifying of the customer’s
credit worthiness is done by predicting the credit score, which
ranges from 300 to 900. Before predicting the credit score, we
have to deal with the missing values in the dataset. We have used
the following imputation techniques: Imputation using mean and
kNN Imputation, to fill in the missing values and described why
is one better than the other. Now onto the credit score, we built
four ML models to train our dataset, and compared the accuracy
of each of the models and selected the best. As a result, we are
developing a system that identifies the candidates deserving of
receiving a loan of a specific amount using a quantifiable metric
calculated using the borrower’s data. This system can then be
automated into a system that accepts these massive amounts of
data and provides us with just one piece of information over all
others: should the bank lend to this particular borrower, this
particular sum, or not. The data is sourced from the Resource
drive [1] of a Risk Modelling tutorial by Skillcate.
